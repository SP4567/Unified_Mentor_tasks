# Unified_Mentor_tasks

1. The repository contains all the tasks that I did during the internship.
2. Three projects were given to me for the tasks:
# Project-1: Heart Disease Analysis
   
# Data Preprocessing:

Loading and exploring the dataset.

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical variables.

# Feature Engineering:

Normalizing features using a scaler.

# Model Training:

Building a machine learning model (likely a neural network, given the use of Keras).

Training the model on the prepared dataset.

Evaluating the model performance using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.

# Model Saving:

Saving the trained model as an HDF5 file.

Saving the scaler object using pickle.

# Model Deployment:

Defining a function to use the trained model and scaler for making predictions based on new input data.

The notebook includes visualizations and evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.

# Project-2: Amazon Sales Analysis

# Data Preprocessing:

Loading and exploring the dataset.

Handling missing values and data cleaning.

Feature selection and engineering.

# Model Training:

Building and training regression models to predict crop production.

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Training various models and selecting the best-performing one.

# Model Evaluation:

Calculating performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R2 Score.

Evaluating the model's performance on the test set and comparing predictions with actual values.

# Visualizations:

Visualizing the data distribution and model performance using plots.

# Saving the Model:

Saving the trained model and any necessary preprocessing tools for future use.

The notebook includes detailed steps and code for each part of the process, along with output and visualizations to assess the model's effectiveness.
